# 👋 Hi, I'm Ramazan
**Full-Stack Developer · Android Engineer · Backend-Oriented Thinker**

I focus on building reliable, maintainable, and thoughtfully architected software. My strength is in understanding both sides of development — frontend and backend — and connecting them with clean structure, readable logic, and consistent behavior.

---

## 🚀 What I Do
- **Mobile Development (Kotlin)** — building clean, scalable Android apps with Firebase or custom backends.
- **Backend Engineering** — Laravel & Python, API design, data flow, DB structure, real-world logic.
- **Frontend** — practical UI that supports functionality without unnecessary complexity.
- **Architecture** — clear separation of concerns, predictable state, maintainable codebases.

## 📌 Selected Projects
### 🧠 Word Trainer (Kotlin)
A streamlined vocabulary trainer designed to make language learning quick and efficient.
- Guess translations between English and another language
- Clean logic and simple UI
- Fast, lightweight, and easy to extend

### ☕ Online Coffee Shop (Kotlin + Firebase)
A full-featured coffee ordering simulation app.
- Categories, popular items, dynamic lists

- Coffee details, cart system, auto price calculation
- Well-structured models and architecture for growth

---

## 🎯 Principles I Follow
- Code should be **predictable** and **easy to reason about**.
- Features must serve a real purpose — not exist “just because”.
- Architecture matters more than adding more tools.
- Good software comes from **clarity**, not complexity.
- Keep improving — quietly, consistently, long-term.
